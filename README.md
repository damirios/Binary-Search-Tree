## Binary Search Tree<br/>*Project from The Odin Project*

#### Includes methods:
* build tree
* insert node - accepts a value to insert
* delete node - accepts a value to delete
* find node - accepts a value and returns the node with the given value
* level order - accepts another function as a parameter and traverse the tree in breadth-first level order and provide each node as the argument to the provided function
* inorder, preorder, postorder - accept a function parameter. Each of these functions should traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order and yield each node to the provided function given as an argument
* height - accepts a node and returns its height. Height is defined as the number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node
* depth - accepts a node and returns its depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in path from a given node to the tree’s root node
* isBalanced - checks if the tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1
* rebalance - rebalances an unbalanced tree
